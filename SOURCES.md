## Context sources (non-anchor)

Context sources may be cited for architectural framing.
They do **not** replace primary anchors.

- **IETF RFC 5405 — UDP Usage Guidelines**  
  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5405.html

- **IEEE 1588 — Precision Time Protocol (PTP)**  
  https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1588-2019.html

## Citation discipline

- Protocol and interface claims must reference at least one **primary source**.  
- Context sources may explain usage but must not redefine scope.  
- No restricted or licensed text is reproduced.  
- URLs are selected for **canonical status and long-term stability**.
